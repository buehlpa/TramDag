Pytorch implementation of **TRA**nsformation **M**odels in **D**irected **A**cyclic **G**raphs (**TRAMDAG**)

üîßüë∑ Work in progress 

The Repos for the separate continous case and the ordinal case are in 

- github.com/buehlpa/contram_pytorch
- github.com/liherz/ontram_pytorch


This repo allows to independently model each node in a graph and model the SCM functions
such that if the SCM is learned, interventions can be applied and Interventional distributions can be obtained


In addition to the original implenetation in R this repo allows for:

-  interactions in Complex models
  
- independent training of NNs instead of MAF.

# How to Use

## Encoding of Ordinal and Continuous Variables in TramDAG

In the **TramDAG framework**, nodes can act both as **predictors (X)** and as **targets (Y)**.  
The way a node is modelled depends on its data type:

- **Continuous variables** (`‚àà ‚Ñù`)  
  Always modelled the same way for neural networks (regression-style output).

- **Ordinal variables**  
  Can be modelled in different ways:
  - As **continuous inputs** (e.g. standardized integers, or raw integers from the dataset).
  - As **nominal/categorical inputs** (e.g. one-hot encoding).

### Example: Models for X4 and X5

The figure below shows an example where nodes `X1`‚Äì`X4` are **ordinal**, and `X5` is **continuous**:

- **Model X4**  
  - Inputs:  
    - `X2` is treated as continuous (40 classes).  
    - `X1` and `X3` are one-hot encoded.  
  - Target:  
    - `X4` is ordinal ‚Üí trained with an ordinal loss.  

- **Model X5**  
  - Input:  
    - `X4` is treated as continuous.  
  - Target:  
    - `X5` is continuous ‚Üí trained with a continuous loss.  

---

### Key Idea
- The **X-specification** controls how variables are **encoded as predictors**.  
- The **Y-specification** controls how variables are **encoded as targets** (i.e. which loss is applied).
